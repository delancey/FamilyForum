        <h4>Who is Family Forum For Homeless Veterans&nbsp;Foundation? </h4>

        <p>Located in Charlotte, NC we are the oldest grant per diem program (GPD) in the city. We are a non-profit agency on the cutting edge of providing cost effective services for our heroes in transition. We provide a drug and alcohol free environment, case management services, budgeting, supportive assistance with employment and permanent housing, transportation to VA medical appointments, recovery groups, computer room, full service cafeteria services, a convenience store, and most importantly, we provide a safe haven for all our veterans.  </p>

        <h4>How can you help?</h4>

        <p>While some of our heroes receive funding from the government, we are in need of additional funding to expand our services locally thereby reducing the instance of turning away a worthy hero who needs supportive housing. We are proud of our Facility. We encourage everyone to come by for a tour to learn more about our organization and see how you can become involved in supporting this worthy cause.  </p>

        <p>We believe we have something special here and you need to see it for yourself. </p>

        <p>The North Carolina Low Income Housing Coalition was formed in 1988 in response to diminishing federal funds and the increasing housing needs of the stateâ€™s low and moderate-income residents to lobby for the creation of the North Carolina Housing Trust Fund. Renamed the North Carolina Housing Coalition in 2004, we are proud of nearly 30 years of advocacy achievements at the federal, state, and local levels. Together with strategic partners we are creating thriving communities with opportunity for all.</p>
